   The Basic Model Interface (BMI) is a library specification to
   simplify the coupling of models.

   </p>

In order to simplify conversion of an existing model to a reusable,
plug-and-play model component, the
`Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System <https://csdms.colorado.edu>`_
(CSDMS) has developed a simple
interface called the *Basic Model Interface* or *BMI* that model
developers are asked to implement.  Recall that in this
context an *interface* is a named set of functions with prescribed
function names, argument types and return types.  The BMI functions
make the model *self-describing* and fully *controllable* by a
modeling framework or application.

By design, the BMI functions are straightforward to implement in
any language and use only simple (universal) data types. While the
CSDMS model coupling framework supports `C`_, `C++`_, `Fortran`_,
`Java`_, and `Python`_, a BMI can described for any language.  CSDMS
provides example bindings for BMI in each of the above languages.

Also by design, the BMI functions are *noninvasive*.  This means
that a BMI-compliant model does not make any calls to other
components or tools and is not modified to use any
framework-specific data structures. BMI therefore introduces no
dependencies into a model and the model can still be used
in a *stand-alone* manner.

The most current development version is always available from our git repository:
