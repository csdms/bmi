The Basic Model Interface
=========================

The functions that comprise the Basic Model Interface
can be grouped into categories:

* :ref:`metadata_funcs`
* :ref:`control_funcs`
* :ref:`info_funcs`
* :ref:`var_funcs`
* :ref:`time_funcs`
* :ref:`getter_setter_funcs`
* :ref:`grid_funcs`

Table 3 lists the individual BMI functions
along with a brief description.
Following the table is a detailed description of each function,
including the function prototype in :term:`SIDL`,
grouped by functional category.

**Implementation notes**

* *Parallel*: All functions MUST be called on all MPI threads.
  When a function returns a status code, the value returned SHOULD be the same across all MPI threads.
  All other return arguments MUST be the same across all MPI threads unless explicitly stated otherwise.
