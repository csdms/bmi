.. _grid_funcs:

Model grid functions
--------------------

The functions in this section describe :ref:`model grids <model_grids>`. 
In the BMI,
every :term:`exchange item` is defined on a grid,
and is referenced by a :term:`grid identifier`
returned from the :ref:`get_var_grid` function.
This identifier is a required input to the functions listed below.

A model can have multiple grids.
For example,
consider modeling the diffusion of temperature over a flat plate.
One grid could be a uniform rectilinear grid on which
temperature is defined.
A second grid could be a scalar,
on which a constant thermal diffusivity is defined.

Not all grid functions are used by each type of grid.
However, all BMI grid functions must be implemented.
(See :ref:`model_grids` and :ref:`best_practices`.)


.. _get_grid_type:

*get_grid_type*
...............

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_type(in int grid, out string type);

Given a :term:`grid identifier`, get the type of that grid as a string.
Valid grid types are:

* ``scalar``
* ``points``
* ``vector``
* ``unstructured``
* ``structured_quadrilateral``
* ``rectilinear``
* ``uniform_rectilinear``

A detailed description of the grid types supported in BMI
is given in the :ref:`model_grids` section.

**Implementation notes**

* In C++, Java, and Python, the *type* argument is omitted and the grid
  type name is returned from the function as a string.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

.. _get_grid_rank:

*get_grid_rank*
...............

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_rank(in int grid, out int rank);

Given a :term:`grid identifier`, get the :term:`rank` (the number of
dimensions) of that grid as an integer.

A grid's rank determines the length of the return value
of several grid functions.
For example,
both :ref:`get_grid_shape` and :ref:`get_grid_coordinate_names`
return an array of length *rank*.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is needed for every :ref:`grid type <model_grids>`.
* In C++, Java, and Python, the *rank* argument is omitted and the grid
  rank is returned from the function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

.. _get_grid_size:

*get_grid_size*
...............

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_size(in int grid, out int size);

Given a :term:`grid identifier`,
get the total number of elements (or :term:`nodes <node>`)
of that grid as an integer.

The grid size is used for, among other things, the
length of arrays returned by :ref:`get_grid_coordinate`
for :ref:`unstructured <unstructured_grids>` and
:ref:`structured quad <structured_quad>` grids.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is needed for every :ref:`grid type <model_grids>`.
* In C++, Java, and Python, the *size* argument is omitted and the grid
  size is returned from the function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

[:ref:`grid_funcs` | :ref:`basic_model_interface`]


.. _get_grid_shape:

*get_grid_shape*
................

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_shape(in int grid, in array<int, 1> shape);

Get the dimensions of the model grid.

Note that this function (as well as the other grid functions)
returns information ordered with "ij" indexing (as opposed to "xy").
For example,
consider a two-dimensional rectilinear grid
with four columns (``nx = 4``)
and three rows (``ny = 3``).
The :ref:`get_grid_shape` function would return a shape
of ``[ny, nx]``, or ``[3,4]``.
If there were a third dimension, the length of the *z*-dimension, ``nz``,
would be listed first.

Also note that the grid shape is the number of :term:`nodes <node>`
in the coordinate directions and not the number of cells or elements.
It is possible for grid values to be associated with the nodes or with
the cells.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is used for describing all :ref:`structured grids
  <structured_grids>`.
* In Python, the *shape* argument is a :term:`numpy <NumPy>` array.
* In C++ and Java, this is a void function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

..................

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_spacing(in int grid, in array<double, 1> spacing);

Get the distance between the :term:`nodes <node>` of the model grid.

The :ref:`get_grid_spacing` function provides the width of each cell in
the number of dimensions as returned by :ref:`get_grid_rank`.
As with :ref:`get_grid_shape`,
the spacing is given in "ij" indexing* order;
e.g., for a two-dimensional grid,
the spacing between rows is followed by spacing between columns, ``[dy, dx]``.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is used for describing :ref:`uniform rectilinear
  <uniform_rectilinear>` grids.
* In Python, the *spacing* argument is a :term:`numpy <NumPy>` array.
* In C++ and Java, this is a void function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

Get the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the model grid.

The *origin* parameter is a one-dimensional array of the size
returned by :ref:`get_grid_rank`.
As with :ref:`get_grid_shape`,
the origin is given in "ij" indexing* order;
e.g., for a two-dimensional grid,
the origin is given in the column dimension, followed by the row dimension,
``[y0, x0]``.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is used for describing :ref:`uniform rectilinear
  <uniform_rectilinear>` grids.
* In Python, the *origin* argument is a :term:`numpy <NumPy>` array.
* In C++ and Java, this is a void function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

coordinate direction.

The length of the resulting one-dimensional array depends on the grid type.
(It will use a value from either :ref:`get_grid_shape` or :ref:`get_grid_size`.)
See :ref:`model_grids` for more information.

**Implementation notes**

  :ref:`structured quadrilateral <structured_quad>`,
  and all :ref:`unstructured <unstructured_grids>` grids.
* In Python, the *y* argument is a :term:`numpy <NumPy>` array.
* In C++ and Java, this is a void function.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.

.. _get_grid_z:

*get_grid_z*
............

.. code-block:: java

   int get_grid_z(in int grid, in array<double, 1> z);

.. deprecated:: 2.1
   Use :ref:`get_grid_coordinate` instead.

Get the locations of the grid :term:`nodes <node>` in the third
coordinate direction.

.. versionadded:: 2.1

Given a :term:`grid identifier`,
get an array of the coordinate names defined for the grid;
e.g., ``["x", "y", "z"]``,
or ``["x1", "x2", "x3"]``,
or ``["lon", "lat", "hgt"]``, etc.
The length of the array is given by :ref:`get_grid_rank`.

**Implementation notes**

* This function is used for describing all :ref:`grid types <model_grids>`.
* In C and Fortran, the names are passed back as an array of character pointers
  (because the coordinate names could have differing lengths), and an integer
  status code indicating success (zero) or failure (nonzero) is returned.
* In C++, the argument is omitted and the names are returned from the function
  in a vector, a standard container in the language.
* In Java, the argument is omitted and the names are returned from the function
  in a string array, a standard container in the language.
* In Python, the argument is omitted and the names are returned from the

.. _get_grid_crs:

*get_grid_crs*
...............

.. code-block:: java

   /* SIDL */
   int get_grid_crs(in int grid, out string crs);

.. versionadded:: 2.1

Given a :term:`grid identifier`,
get `coordinate reference system`_ (CRS) information for the grid as a string.

Note that the BMI doesn't specify which standard to use
for the output of this function---that's left to the implementation.
We can, however, make recommendations;
e.g., OGC `Well-Known Text`_ (WKT), `PROJ`_, or `EPSG`_.

A small example:
if you have data in a projected CRS,
say, UTM zone 13 North with the WGS84 datum,
you could use `spatialreference.org`_ to find information about this projection
(`EPSG:32613 <https://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-13n/>`_)
and return it from :ref:`get_grid_crs`
as (for example) a PROJ string:

.. code-block:: none

  +proj=utm +zone=13 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 

or as WKT:

.. code-block:: none

  PROJCS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 13N",
    GEOGCS["WGS 84",
        DATUM["WGS_1984",
            SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
        UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]],
    UNIT["metre",1,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],
    PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",-105],
    PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","32613"],
    AXIS["Easting",EAST],
    AXIS["Northing",NORTH]]

as you prefer.

**Implementation notes**

* In C++, Java, and Python, the *crs* argument is omitted and the CRS
  is returned from the function as a string.
* In C and Fortran, an integer status code indicating success (zero) or failure
  (nonzero) is returned.
* A return string of ``""`` or ``"none"`` (but not the UDUNITS ``"1"``, which
  could be taken as an `EPSG code`_) indicates no projection information.
