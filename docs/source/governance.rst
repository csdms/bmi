The Basic Model Interface (BMI): governance and decision-making
===============================================================

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process
used for the Basic Model Interface (BMI)
in both ordinary and extraordinary situations,
and to clarify how decisions are made
and how the various elements of our community interact,
including the relationship between open source collaborative development
and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.

Summary
-------

The Basic Model Interface (BMI) is a community-owned and community-run project.
To the maximum extent possible, decisions about project direction
are made by community consensus
(but note that "consensus" here has a somewhat technical meaning
that might not match everyone's expectations--see below).
Some members of the community additionally contribute
by serving on the Steering Council (see below),
where they are responsible
for facilitating the establishment of community consensus,
for stewarding project resources,
and--in extreme cases--for making project decisions
if the normal community-based process breaks down.
