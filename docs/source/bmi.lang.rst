BMI Bindings
------------

The following header files demonstrate how the BMI specification
is expressed in different languages.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   bmi.lang.sidl
   bmi.lang.c
   bmi.lang.cxx
   bmi.lang.py
   bmi.lang.fortran

Download the language file of your choice
and use it to implement a BMI for a model.

   Is there a way to actually make the files downloadable as well? Right now, I see the actual text of the interfaces on the page (which is good), but a link to download would also be useful.
